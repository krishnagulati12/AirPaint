# AirPaint
The Air Canvas project is an interactive computer vision application that allows users to draw on a virtual canvas in real-time using hand gestures. The project utilizes OpenCV for video processing and Mediapipe for accurate hand tracking, enabling users to draw in the air without physical contact with any surface.
