# AirPaint
The Air Canvas project is an interactive computer vision application that allows users to draw on a virtual canvas in real-time using hand gestures. The project utilizes OpenCV for video processing and Mediapipe for accurate hand tracking, enabling users to draw in the air without physical contact with any surface.
Key Features:
Hand Tracking: The application tracks the user's hand and identifies key landmarks such as the forefinger and thumb.
Gesture Recognition: Drawing is activated when the forefinger is detected, and color selection or canvas clearing occurs when the thumb and forefinger touch.
Color Selection: Users can switch between four different colors—blue, green, red, and yellow—by hovering over the respective color buttons.
Clear Functionality: The canvas can be reset by hovering over the "CLEAR" button.
Real-Time Drawing: The drawing is displayed on both the live video feed and a separate canvas window, allowing for an intuitive drawing experience.
This project demonstrates the integration of computer vision techniques and hand gesture recognition to create a touch-free drawing application, showcasing the capabilities of modern AI frameworks like Mediapipe.
